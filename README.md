# portfolio

I created this web portfolio using things that I learned this semester as well as last semester. All the resources I used were either past assignments, or a google search (primarily w3schools). I had a lot of trouble getting it to look the way that I want, but I still managed to get it to be alright. I added a lot of hovers because it's the thing I know how to do that isn't too hard.

So let's start from the top. I had trouble adding the navigation with a 50% opacity background at first. Then I followed the increase your flexibility assignment and got it to work on the home page. The other pages however, it didn't work on. No idea why, but I decided to leave it the way it was because it didn't look too bad, even though it wasn't what I originally wanted. I made the logo a clickable link that takes the user back to the home page.

Using media queries to style the nav was hard because the logo stuck in the left corner and I couldn't get it to center. I didn't have time to add a hamburger menu but it's something that I am definitely going to add in the future.

The next issue was the header image. It would either stretch or be too small and it wouldn't scale the way I want. I couldn't figure it out so all the header images are repeated. I don't love that but I just couldn't figure it out and I feel like I tried everything that google was telling me to do.

The "Hi I'm Kat" section went relatively smoothly and I used grids to get it to 2 columns. It changes to 1 column when the screen gets smaller using media queries. With all of the images, it is a circle and I had trouble making it a circle because when using border-radius on a rectangular image, it makes an oval, not a circle. I solved this by just cropping the images in PhotoShop beforehand into a square to make my life easier.

The portfolio section also worked pretty well even though it took a little bit for me to figure out how to put the heading underneath the images. (Just put a <p> or <h4> inside the same div!! Why didn't I figure it out earlier?)

The contact page gave me trouble because the form isn't working well with the grids and it still isn't. The heading doesn't match the form and I couldn't figure it out. Other than that it worked okay. The submit button isn't lined up perfectly but adding padding didn't help so it isn't perfectly aligned.

THE FOOTER was giving me trouble because the social media icons were way too big and I couldn't scale it down. Also, the back to top button wasn't touching the bottom of the screen and I couldn't figure out why. It's still in the css code but as a comment so feel free to check it out. Or don't because it looks bad.

I decided to just add the back to top button and make it look nice over trying to implement the social media that I couldn't figure out. The copyright was easy to do.

Next, the portfolio pages were all done the same way but with different images. It all went the way I wanted except for the fact that I needed 3 js files because putting the code one on top of the other wouldn't work. It would only register the first syntax (ie. only one of the portfolio pages would have pictures). 

I tried using media queries to change the grid from 3 columns to 2, to 1 as the size went down, but it didn't work and I didn't know why. I still don't know why. Everything else was working but the grid wouldn't change.

In the future I will definitely keep this design and add more images, categories, and a hamburger menu for sure. I want to fix all the issues I have eventually, like the header images etc. Also a modal for the images would be nice to add. 

I learned a lot creating this portfolio and reviewed concepts from last semester as well as this semester. I'm glad that I was able to create this! Thank you Natalia and Katherine I really wouldn't have been able to do this without you!
